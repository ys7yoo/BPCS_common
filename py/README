```bash
pip install PyWavelets
```

The file BP.py is the standalone BP solver.
Comparison.py is the example with the phantom (without L1 to simplify).
To use just type "python comparison.py" or "./comparison.py" in the terminal.
Note that you should have python installed with the following packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and pywavelet.

Example: try ./comparison.py 0.28
